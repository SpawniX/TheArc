            Roblox, also known as 'blox or Pedoblox, is a popular Lego ripoff game platform that allows users to create and play games designed by themselves within it. 
            Due to its nature, it has attracted a high number of children, autists, and subsequently pedophiles and groomers. 
            It is now a content farm and the second most popular pedophile hotspot thanks to the Jew isreaeli Zionist CEO, (((David Baszucki))) (defended pedos btw) where skids spend Ϫ gorillion of their parents money on avatars and games.
            While there are still good people who try to help the community, there are sadly a lot of 'cordpedo that outweigh them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks for their shitty ass moderation and code more broken that the <b>25' Operation Lulzit</b> created a entire community of exploiters on their game
            being normally <s> Devs that were rejected,banned,kicked from a project</s> skids or advanced joes on luaU and the pedoblox environment. 
          </p>
        <h2> RoHistory </h2>
          <p>
            Roblox was released in 2006, but the actual year it released depends on how much assburgers you have.[dynablocks o algo] <br>
            In its infancy, Roblox (actually known as ROBLOX officially) was a online LEGO building simulation where you could create games places and play with other people over 9530ms dialup connections. Early Roblox had limited avatar customization, limited scripting, and everything you built was confined to a minimum of a 1x1 lego brick. Somewhere in the mid 2010's Roblox started shifting it's priorities to expand the game to be more realistic or something, right after the co founder died and all of the original younger employees left or retired, and since then the game has been on an endless downward spiral, as of the freedom of players to create what they want expands while the moderation and enforcement of what's being created hasn't increased. So now anyone can upload <a href="https://www.roblox.com/catalog?Keyword=woman&taxonomy=kj535RzJxHTCnXPBLo5KaE&salesTypeFilter=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sexual clothing[1]</a> and <a href="www.roblox.com/catalog?CatalogContext=1&Keyword=silly+cat&Category=1&salesTypeFilter=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">furry shit[2]</a> to the avatar store as they please. Luckily, 'blox has a Warrior doing his hardest to prevent these wretched actions and cleanse the site, trying to maintain a safe way for Gen Alpha to have fun (and get money stolen from parents in gambling games, because Roblox is an entity in the service of Moloch, stealing children's time and money away from them for no reward). They also have a financial incentive to not take down EPI material, since Roblox takes 77% of the cut they get from payouts, so groomed children are an actual part of the market. <br>
           </p> <p>
            Despite this, the game platform can be pretty entertaining, even doe you have to look really hard to find anything that's actually well balanced or however the game designs, just play with friends, ok? Avoid 95% of the front page shit, it's all pretty equally garbage, but why would you want to play Roblox anyways? <br>
           </p> <p>
            In late 2020 some guy made a recreation of Changed on Roblox and popular 'blox YouTuber Flamingo played it. The game instantly became popular and the idea spread like wildfire because children like fluffy animals. Furry transfurmation content is subtle enough to get a pass from the outsourced moderation team and AI moderation, so the result is that large swaths of Gen Alpha are getting exposed to 'P fetish material at this very minute. The most popular "transfurmation" game on Roblox is Kaiju Paradise, getting almost 1,000 players in a day. You VVILL help take these games down. <br>
           </p> <p>
            During the later 2020s, pedos flocked to the 'blox to make condos, the 'blox equivalent of (((Epstein))) Island. In 2021 notorious troll Ruben Sim got banned from the 'blox for "breaking the terms of service". He found out that they were still observing his social media accounts, where he was exploiting a loophole which made it easier to ban gooners and pedos off the 'blox. He has visited the Sharty multiple times since then and some exploiters are fans of him. In 2025, a bunch of shit happened. [Keyed type shit] <br>
           </p> <p>
            As of around 6 months ago[when?], just to prove how retarded 'blox jannies are, if you looked up "spade" in groups, you'd instantly see countless BBC fetish groups full of actual pedos larping as 'p workers or underaged white girls. Hopefully, 'blox moderators, after getting BTFOd by the community, finally decided to take some action against them.
