        A skid, kidd, kiddo (or “FAKIDDS” on The Archive) is a
        <s>person that should be thrown into Stiggahell</s>
        person that uses other people's code, tools, or exploits
        without understanding how they work and claims credit in the
        laziest way. <br> They normally live in their mom’s house and weigh
        about 100kg (220.46 lb in burger units).
      </p>
      <p>
        Skids are commonly found on <b> TicTac,dihscord,twinter (or X,idk how to call that) and some Tech social medias,
        they also mostly use c00lkid based avatars with just a recolor and just change the starting text (Ex: P00lkidd,L0LKidd or something that nobody cares about).</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        in rare cases when a skid starts learning the most little of real exploiting,they will create their own guis,most of them are <s> shitty larps of clientside that nobody can see,but they are too stupid for knowing that </s>
        clientside/visual,meaning they have no effect over anything or anyone,but in the most RARE and GEMMY cases,<b> a skid discover about require function and create a real skidGui <br> some knowed Skids are:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Darius Team</li>
          <li>t00bkidd</li>
          <li>someone called p00lkidd (he sells pools)</li>
          <li>And other skids</li> <b>
        </ul>
      <p>
        there are some small branches of skids,like the <b> tuber93 larpies or the harkninian copys <b>,there are also some skids that have their own normal avatars,but all are the same as the others
      </b> </b> </p>
